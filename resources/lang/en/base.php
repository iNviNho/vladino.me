                <strong>Martin</strong> in a <strong>beautiful country Slovakia</strong>. 
                I was born in a great family with inspiring people that taught me to always stay <strong>polite</strong>, don't loose <strong>friendliness</strong>, 
                <strong>work hard</strong>
                and <strong>combine heart with mind</strong> when making decisions.<br><br>

                Throughout my life i came across some very exciting and interesting things that formed me into a person i am now with a goal and 
                path that i keep <strong>following every single day.</strong><br><br>

                My first steps with technologies started at university back in 2012. What followed afterwards had the biggest impact on my knowledge. 
                We can count an amount of numerous projects i was working on and countless hours watching, learning and reading docs behind a closed door. 
                I am a believer of a quote that <strong>it does not count what you do on a pitch while game is on, but what you do afterwards.</strong>",
